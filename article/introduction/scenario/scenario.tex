\subsection{The protocol: To hop or not to hop}

The base station will be requesting the heart rate from the runner node with a packet size of 128 bytes and save it to memory. When the runner node is out of range, the north or south relay station will receive the request from the base station and relay it to the runner. We will look at energy costs and signal strength when deciding to hop or not.
