\subsection{Sink: Base Station}\label{sc:sinkBaseStation}
The required detail of information needed to give a good user estimate will raise the question of acceptable package loss. Signal strength, package frequency, package loss vs reliability from both pole stations and source will determine the power consumption of the base station and the system. The base station will never be in idle state and it must be able to reach pole station resulting in the highest cost function of the system.
