abstract = {Numerous localization protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks are based on Received Signal Strength Indicator. Because absolute positioning is not always available, localization based on RSSI is popular. More, no extra hardware is needed unlike solutions based on infra-red or ultrasonic. Moreover, the theory gives a RSSI as a function of distance. However, using RSSI as a distance metric involves errors in the measured values, resulting path-loss, fading, and shadowing effects. We present experimentation results from three large WSNs, each with up to 250 nodes. Based on our findings from the 3 systems, the relation between RSSI and distance is investigated according to the topology properties and the radio environment. We underline the intrinsic limitations of RSSI as a distance metric, in terms of accuracy and stability. Contrary to what we assumed, collaborative localization protocol based on Spring-Relaxation algorithm can not smooth the distance-estimation errors obtained with RSSI measurements.},
