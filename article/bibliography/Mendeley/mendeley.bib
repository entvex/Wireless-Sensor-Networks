abstract = {Sensor networks with battery-powered nodes can seldom simultaneously meet the design goals of lifetime, cost, sensing reliability and sensing and transmission coverage. Energy-harvesting, converting ambient energy to electrical energy, has emerged as an alternative to power sensor nodes. By exploiting recharge opportunities and tuning performance parameters based on current and expected energy levels, energy harvesting sensor nodes have the potential to address the conflicting design goals of lifetime and performance. This paper surveys various aspects of energy harvesting sensor systems- architecture, energy sources and storage technologies and examples of harvesting-based nodes and applications. The study also discusses the implications of recharge opportunities on sensor node operation and design of sensor network solutions.},

abstract = {Numerous localization protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks are based on Received Signal Strength Indicator. Because absolute positioning is not always available, localization based on RSSI is popular. More, no extra hardware is needed unlike solutions based on infra-red or ultrasonic. Moreover, the theory gives a RSSI as a function of distance. However, using RSSI as a distance metric involves errors in the measured values, resulting path-loss, fading, and shadowing effects. We present experimentation results from three large WSNs, each with up to 250 nodes. Based on our findings from the 3 systems, the relation between RSSI and distance is investigated according to the topology properties and the radio environment. We underline the intrinsic limitations of RSSI as a distance metric, in terms of accuracy and stability. Contrary to what we assumed, collaborative localization protocol based on Spring-Relaxation algorithm can not smooth the distance-estimation errors obtained with RSSI measurements.},
