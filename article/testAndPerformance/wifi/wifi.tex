\section{WiFi conditions}\label{sc:wifi}
In our test we used two different WiFi channels (4 and 11) and we found the best and the worst by using the WiFi Analyzer app from the Android app store\cite{Farproc@gmail.com2018}. As seen in figure \ref{fig:wifionthetestday}, channel 11 is used by Aarhus University WiFi, but channel 4 looks rather free, so we picked both as seen in table \ref{table:scenarios}.
