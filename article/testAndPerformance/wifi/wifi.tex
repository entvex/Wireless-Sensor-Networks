\section{WiFi conditions}\label{sc:wifi}
In our test we used two different WiFi channels (4 and 11) and we found the best and the worst by using the WiFi Analyzer app\footnote{\cite{wifi}} from the Android app store. As seen in figure \ref{fig:wifionthetestday}, channel 11 is used by Aarhus University WiFi, but channel 4 looks rather free, so we picked both as seen in table \ref{table:scenarios}. The -40 RSSI value is calculated from the telosb data sheet\footnote{\cite{CrossbowTechnologyInc.2004}} by taking the stated receive sensitivity of the TPR2420CA chip ($-94dbm$), subtracting $-10dbm$ to accommodate for noise and converting to CC2420 RSSI by subtracting a offset of -45\footnote{\cite{Ieee}}.
