Figure 10 (left) shows the base station's RF input power of a run around the track from start to finish and figure 10 (right) shows it for 47 rounds, which equals a marathon, and each round has different fading. Figure \ref{fig:recievedSignal_inRange_halfTrack} shows the in-range of the base station packets which needs to be relayed or not.

\noindent A multi linear regression was fitted on the simulated data with three predictors: Distance, signal strength and whether the packet had been relayed before. The goal was to determine if the node should relay the next packet or not. Since signal strength and distance are strongly correlated in our simulation, due to antenna approximations and the binary behavior of the fading, they cancel each other out, while the previous packet status shows a $10\%$ likelihood of the next packet needing to be relayed. Again, it is expected since the simulations have fading behavior added as a random variable appearing with a $10\%$ likelihood. A real-life trial would be interesting, but is out of scope. Figure \ref{fig:regressionPlot} shows the regression plot with the linear equation added in a legend box.
