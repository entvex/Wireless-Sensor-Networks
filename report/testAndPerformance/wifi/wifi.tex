\section{Wifi condisions}\label{sc:wifi}
In our tests we used WiFi channels and we found the worst and best one using the 
Wifi Analyzer app from the app store\cite{Farproc@gmail.com2018}. As seen in figure \ref{fig:wifionthetestday} channel 11 is used by the AU and there is no one using channel 4, therefore we choosed thease channels for our test as seen in table \ref{table:scenarios}.
