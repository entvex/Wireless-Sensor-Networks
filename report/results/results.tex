\chapter{Results}\label{ch:results}

Using the test setup and mechanics described in \ref{ch:testAndPerformance}, we conducted a experiment of four different scenarios. We wanted to see whether the hopping frequency would increase, when we increased the circumference of the track, evaluate the package sent/loss ratio and measure the overall perception of data. The test results would indicate if our hopping algorithm, the implemented ARQ protocol and distance measurements were correct and working. The four scenarios are described in chapter \ref{ch:testAndPerformance}.
