\section{Power Consumption}\label{sc:powerConsumption}
\subsection{Source: Node A}
Source node A will be transmitting at a periodic transmission rate. Different levels of power consumption will be determined by the chosen protocol, but, in any case, the power consumption will be considered, over a period of one second, constant. The less power consumption of node A will give longer individual lifetime and runtime for the runner, but low signal strength of node A might not give a lowest possible system power consumption. Depending on the needed quality of the received package, e.g. -84dBm, a cut of distance will be calculated and measured. Distance measuring will be limited by interference providing a need for a scalable transfer function estimate and an average over multiple measurements. Life time of node A will be considered when half of the battery capacity is used.

\subsection{Sink and Source: North and South Station}

Idle time, receiving and transmitting power consumption will be calculated and measure. When out of range the “pole” stations will in theory go to an idle state to save power. When in transmitting mode different measurements will be conducted depending on the chosen protocol. E.g. firm or no handshakes between pole station and base station will be measured leading to different possible distances between jumps.
