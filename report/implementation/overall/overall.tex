\section{Generic ARQ implementation}\label{sc:overall}

The ARQ stop-and-wait method has been implemented on all nodes in the system. Figure \ref{fig:tohopornotarqsequence} is a sequence diagram of the  protocol implementation and shows how data requests are initiated by the base station and forwarded either directly to the runner  (left side) or via a relay station (right side).
