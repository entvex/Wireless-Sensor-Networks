Signal strength = Euclidean Distance(time after initialization)
Noise (Fast fade, Slow fade, Deep fade)

simulated fast fade(10-100ms)(30-40dB signal strength fluctuations)
	Random function duration, between boundaries, of random amplitude, between boundaries
	"Deep Fade is when a package is lost due to fast fade!"

simulated slow fade(2-120s)(30-40dB gaussian signal strength fluctuations)
	Random function duration, between boundaries of random amplitude, between boundaries
	"Deep Fade is when a package is lost due to fast fade!"

maybe some measured noise in building for estimations to simulations

ACK parameters algorithm based on simulations and distance
	Relay transmissions before retransmission of direct signal, "s" for steps
	Times failed at direct transmission before turning to relaying, "t" for times
