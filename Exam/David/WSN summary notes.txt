WSN summary


1ST PART:

Sensor node architecture
- Three characteristics
- Pros/Cons in the five different major components


Power/Energy supply
- Hardware requirements knowledge
- Lithium and alkaline battery most used batteries
- Continuous Power get worse with time
- Quality relation between each other battery no more is needed


Duty Cycle
- 1st condition: Hardware should support sleep mode (Our mode Active/Idle/Sleep)
- 2nd condition: Time it takes to switch between states, do you actually save energy? Energy save should be higher than energy overhead (turn on)


Dynamic Voltage Scaling
- Lower the voltage when possible


Peak Power Matters
- Lowering the voltage power can increase the overall peak power, beacuse the microcontroller won't die as fast


Computatuion vs. communication energy cost
- Better to compute to decrease communication


Modeling energy consumption during transmission


Modeling energy consumption during receiving



2ND PART

Constraints in WSN
- Hard to make a detailed hardware planning in a WSN


Network architecture
- Optimisations goals are very important
- Quality of service = loss of important events (not packages)
- Scalability, too much sclability can be expensive, it depends a lot on what is needed of the WSN

- Distributed Organization, mac protocl, other layers (distributed protocols/mechanism), where is the brain in the system - it might be distributed ====== Read about this ======


MAC
- Important to understand the 4 main energy problems (waste of energy)


Contention based MAC protocls
- How do these protocol deal with the 4 main energy problems
- Message passing = less overhead
- LPL, Low Power Listening


Link Layer
- The different versions of ARQ
- FEC uses redundancy of messages to correct errors
- What are the tradeoffs of ARQ vs. FEC (good picture in previous slides of this subject)


Data centric networking (networkign layer)
- A purpose to discover the route, but how do we discover the route


Data aggregation (networking layer)
- Spatial and time correlation makes this possible <---- Important
- Reduce network conjestion and energy usage


Transport Layer
- End to End, is the sender that should retransmit
- Hop to Hop, is the last data sender that needs to retransmit


Security
- Avoidance of jamming = mapping of jammer and avoid area or change transmission power to get signal through
