(Troels): QI Comments: Energy Consumption and NOT power consumption!
Explain better the choice of half battery lifetime as indicator vs other indicators
Conclude on the doppler effect that we do not consider it, because we run around the basestation and not towards it!
Explain shortly the math behind doppler effect 
(HENRIK) plus the extention of wavelength!
No RSSI in the report or plots

(Coding Team): Test scenario:
(Henrik): Introduction "The Track"
We have tested the measurable distance in Shannon.
Four nodes, 1 selfdriving toytrain, -24dBm, Building
Height:21cm
LengthLong:47.5cm
speed of train = 3.25 round/min
LenghtSmall:33cm
speed of train = 5 round/min
Total Packages per round = 1087
47 round = 51089 packages
(EXTRA IF TIME) - Blinking diode on relays when transmitting relays (Nice Visual Effect for the video)

(David and Christian)
Two different channel sets (0,1) (10,11 WIFI) - Some reference to how we know that channel 11 is the wifi channel!
Two different Timeouts (????ms, ????ms)
Two different Threshold levels in dBm (-84dBm, SINR threshold) - Some setup which gives us a measured Threshold? Maybe a preliminary lab around the track!

Results:
(Coding Team):
   Number of time outs at the base station
   Number of packages received at the individual relay stations
   (ALL) Short description on how this can be
(Christian): Package loss graph and new estimated multi linear regression line!
(Henrik): Total Energy Consumption for each scenario calculated on number of relays - maybe shown in a powertable!

(ALL) Conclusion!

Extra Considerations:
David: Network Processing!
Christian: CSMA maybe!
