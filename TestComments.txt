(Troels): QI Comments: 
Energy Consumption and NOT power consumption!
No RSSI in the report or plots
Conclude on the doppler effect that we do not consider it, because we run around the basestation and not towards it!
Explain shortly the math behind doppler effect 

(HENRIK) plus the extention of wavelength!
Explain better the choice of half battery lifetime as indicator vs other indicators

(Coding Team): Test scenario:
Introduction "The Track"
We have tested the measurable distance in Shannon.
Four nodes, 1 selfdriving toytrain, -24dBm, Building
Two different channel sets (4) (11 WIFI) - Some reference to how we know that channel 11 is the wifi channel and channel 4!
Two different track sizes -%of track which in theory should be out of range for base station
(EXTRA IF TIME) - Blinking diode on relays when transmitting relays (Nice Visual Effect for the video)

Results:
(Coding Team):
Graphs to show some results
Total Energy Consumption for each scenario calculated on number of relays - maybe shown in a powertable!
   (ALL) Short description on how this can be

(ALL) Conclusion!

Extra Considerations:
David: Network Processing! Scalability!
Christian: CSMA!
Henrik: Energy Harvesting (Solar for Base Station, Pizo for Runner!)
Troels: Snak med Qi om køb af materialer og udstilling af projeketet, plus skriv til BRIO om gratis legetøj pga. reklame
