QI Comments: Energy Consumption and NOT power consumption!
Explain better the choice of half battery lifetime as indicator vs other indicators
Conclude on the doppler effect that we do not consider it, because we run around the basestation and not towards it!
Explain shortly the math behind doppler effect plus extention of wavelength (HENRIK)!

Test scenario:
Four nodes, 1 selfdriving toytrain, -24dBm, Building
Two different channel sets (0,1) (10,11 WIFI)
Two different Timeouts (????ms, ????ms)
Two different Threshold levels in dBm (-84dBm, SINR threshold)
Total Energy Consumption for each scenario calculated on number of relays
Package loss graphs

David: Network Processing!
CSMA maybe!
